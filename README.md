# This project is used for the paper "Rewiring Complex Networks to Achieve Cluster Synchronization using Graph Convolution Networks
with Reinforcement Learning". 

The project contains 3 parts: 

1.RL_GCN_global: Reinforcement learning with graph convolutional network (RL-GCN) to achieve global synchronization in Rosseler system

2.RL_GCN_global_LargeNet: RL-GCN to achieve global synchronization in Hindamarsh-Rose neuronal circuit embedding in a cat-brain network

3.RL_GCN_cluster: RL-GCN to achieve cluster synchronization in Rossleler system
